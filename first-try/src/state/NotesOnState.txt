1. when using onClick={}, we must pass in a lambda function.
    i.e. onClick={() => doSomething} OR
    i.e. function doSomething = () => {  }
         onClick={doSomething}

2. when calling the setterFunction in useXXX (useState / useReducer), we need to pass in an argument.
    - useState: usually just one argument with a single type (LoggedIn.tsx). For one argument with multiple types, 
                check User.tsx
    - useReducer: usually multiple arguments encapsulated into a dictionary (Counter.tsx)

. const [stateVariable, setterFunction] = useState(initialState)
    - the type of stateVariable relies on the type of initialState we passed in

. const [stateVariable, setterFunction] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
    - we need to define our reducer
    - the type of stateVariable relies on the type of initialState we passed in
